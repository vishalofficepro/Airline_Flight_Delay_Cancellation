# Airline Flight Delay & Cancellation Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes flight delays and cancellations across major US airports. Using a dataset of nearly 2,000,000 commercial flights, I explored patterns and trends to understand the factors contributing to delays and cancellations. The project aims to provide insights into airline performance, seasonal trends, and the impact of various airports on flight schedules.

## Tools Used
- **Microsoft Power BI**: For building interactive dashboards and visualizing the data.
- **Microsoft Excel**: For initial data exploration and cleaning.
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)**: To create calculated columns and measures.
- **Power Query**: For data transformation and modeling.

## Key Insights
- **Peak Delay Times**: The highest delays occur during the summer months (June to August) and during the holiday season (December).
- **Airport Performance**: Certain airports like Atlanta (ATL) and Chicago (ORD) tend to experience the most delays.
- **Carrier Impact**: Different airlines have varying levels of punctuality, with some carriers consistently performing better than others.
- **Weather Effects**: Flights during storm-prone months and regions tend to be delayed more frequently.
- **Cancellation Patterns**: A majority of flight cancellations were due to weather-related issues, with notable peaks during winter storms.

## Dataset
- **Source**: The dataset was sourced from the US Department of Transportation, which tracks flight performance across the country.
- **Size**: The dataset includes nearly 2,000,000 flight records from various US airports over multiple years.

## Visualizations
The Power BI dashboard includes:
- **Total Flights**: A KPI card displaying the total number of flights analyzed.
- **Total Delays & Cancellations**: KPIs showing the number of delays and cancellations.
- **Flights by Airport**: A bar chart visualizing the number of flights per airport.
- **Delays by Month**: A line chart showing delay trends over time.
- **Cancellations by Carrier**: A chart displaying cancellation rates by airline.
- **Interactive Filters**: Allowing users to filter data by airport, carrier, and time period.

## How to Use
1. Open the provided Power BI (.pbix) file.
2. Explore the dashboard by interacting with the charts and filters to gain insights into flight performance across different airports and airlines.

## Conclusion
This analysis sheds light on the key factors that impact flight delays and cancellations, offering valuable insights for airlines, passengers, and airport authorities to improve operational efficiency and customer experience.
